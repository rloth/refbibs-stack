He was awarded a PhD degree from the University of Melbourne for a thesis on bistocompatlbility in organ transplantation, and in 1972 was awarded the Selwyn Smith Prize of the University of Melbourne. He has been a Hunterian Professor of the Royal College of Surgeons of England. His publications include: with J FabreThe mechanism of specific immunosuppression of renal allograft rejection by donor strain bloodHbtocompatibility systems, immune response and disease in manRenal transplantation and B-cell cross-matches with autoantibodies and alloantibodies His present department runs a clinical renal transplant programme, with a major programme in transplantation Immunology and pancreatic islet transplantation. Professor Morris is the present Chairman of the British Transplantation Society, and serves on several editorial boards. Including Transplantation and Clinical and Experimental Immunology.
